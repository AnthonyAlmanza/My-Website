    <p class="text-size-small">
      My interest in software development began when I was younger, creating simple scripts for an MMO.
      This passion for programming led me to develop mods for my favorite games,
      which ultimately inspired me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
      <br><br>
      After graduating from college, I eagerly embarked on my career as a software engineer.
      What started as a hobby, writing scripts to automate in-game actions, has evolved into a fulfilling professional journey.
      Today, I am a full-stack developer, leveraging my skills to create comprehensive and efficient software solutions.
