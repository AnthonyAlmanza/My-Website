    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      My interest in software development first sparked in middle school making simple Lua scripts for an MMO. This eventually
      led me to creating mods for some of mym favorite games at the time, fast-forward a few years to me going to college for
      Computer Science.
      <br><br>
      After college I jumped head first into software development and have been working as a software engineer ever since.
      Who would've guessed that making my characters spam messages in chat with a hotkey would've led me down this path.
