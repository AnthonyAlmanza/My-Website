    <h1>About Me.</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! My name is Anthony and I enjoy solving problems, most of the time with technology.
      <br><br>
      I've always been someone that likes to take things apart and put it all back together, or at least attempt to.
      But my interest in software development first sparked in middle school when I made a Lua script for an MMO.
      Who would've guessed that making macros and scripts would lead me down this path!
      <br><br>
      Fast-forward a few years I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and have been working as a full-stack
      developer ever since!

      front-end frameworks to back-end technologies, and all the tooling in-between.
